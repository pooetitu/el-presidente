# El-presidente

## Introduction

### The game

This is a game inspired by Tropico and Reigns. The game is taking place on an island on which you're a dictator. Your
mission will be to make your island prosper, survive the different events that will affect you and avoid an
insurrection.

### The project

The objective of this project is to develop a game with a clean code approach, and using different tools like git to
have a project versioning, maven to have a project dependency management and tests to insure the stability and
reliability of the written code.
